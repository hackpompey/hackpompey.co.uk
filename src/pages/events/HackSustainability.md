# Hack Pompey 2019 - Sustainability

The South Coast’s biggest annual hackathon returns in November for another weekend jam packed with making, solving, and collaborating!

The theme of this year’s event is centred around sustainability. There’s no escaping it, sustainability impacts us at so many different levels and the idea of truly grabbing it by the horns and wrestling with it for the weekend to improve the lives of future generations to come is just too exciting to ignore!

The number of areas this year’s projects might encompass is staggering; improvements to recycling, mitigating food and water waste, making sure everybody has food on their plate and clean water to drink, clean air in our cities, sustainability in fashion, architecture, agriculture, banking, healthcare, retail, transportation, and the list goes on. We are so excited to see what captures the hearts and imaginations of our participants and what projects, large or small, they will create to make a difference.

Over the weekend of the 2nd and 3rd November we will open the doors to the University’s Future Tech Centre for people from all backgrounds and disciplines to join together, learn something new, collaborate, and build something truly remarkable at Hack Pompey. Best of all, as always, it’s completely free!

No matter the project size and scale, we can all do our little bit to make this world that little bit better for generations to come and we can’t wait to see you there!

# Key info <a name="info"></a>

The event will take place over the weekend with each day beginning at 10am and finishing at 6pm. There will be free breakfast and lunch served both days, and we’re very excited to announce that the team from Harbour Coffee will return (this time with coffee truck in tow) to provide the finest coffee for our makers. There will also be free hot and cold beverages available all day to keep everyone fuelled.

We have a great team of volunteers on hand to help bridge any gaps of knowledge and be generally helpful throughout. If you don’t know something, we probably know someone who does!

# Schedule <a name="schedule"></a>

Our reception area where you can pick up your wristband will be open 9:30 - 18:00 both days.

# Frequently asked questions <a name="faq"></a>

### Can I attend as a team?

We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they work together, so we highly encourage our attendees to bring friends along to make a team. If you don't have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity to form a team at the event.

### What should I bring?

Bring your tools and equipment. Laptops, craft supplies, pen & paper, raspberry pis. Whatever you need for making and developing!

### I can't think of a project idea

That's not a question, but also not a problem! There will be a team-forming and idea generation session at the start of the event.
While we encourage you to pick a project related to our sustainability theme, you are free to work on whatever you like.
You can also find some theme related project ideas and resources to get you started below.

# Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

We love to see all the creative, and often unexpected, project ideas our attendees come up with;
so we want to be clear that you are absolutely welcome to work on whatever project idea you have.
If you're stuck for ideas, or aren't sure where we're going with this theme, check out the ideas below:

### Fashion

How can we make fashion and clothing more environmentally friendly? Can we make use of different materials, change where we source them, how we produce them, or use them more efficiently? How can we reduce the amount of clothing that goes to waste or never gets used?

### Architecture

How can we make buildings work for both people _and_ the environment? Could we use sensors, weather data, or modeling to design spaces that require less energy intensive climate control? What changes can we make to building design and construction materials?

### Game Jam

We think games are a great way to engage people and raise awareness of real-world issues. Can you make a game that really gets people thinking?

### And much, much, more...

Sustainability is a key area for improvement in a huge range of sectors including Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Infrastructure, Waste Management, and so many others. There's action we can take everywhere, both large scale and small. Whether it's modelling, designing, prototyping, or raising awareness, there's always some new approach to try or idea to test to make the world we live in better, cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable.
