# The Hack Pompey Team

Hack Pompey began in 2014 as a social hack day at Portsmouth Universityâ€™s Innovation Space. Conceived by two School of Computing undergrads; Zac Colley and Peter Jones, it has since become a non-profit organisation led by a team of six Portsmouth University graduates; Tom Hewett, Louis Capitanchik, Ryan Thicket, Ahsana Choudhury, Ming Wu, and David Ralph.
