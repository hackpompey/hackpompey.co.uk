# Hack Pompey
## This is the biggest hackathon on the South Coast.

Dates and location for our 2019 event are soon to be announced. Follow us to keep up to date with the latest news!

### What is Hack Pompey?

Hack Pompey is the biggest hackathon on the South coast. We'll see people from all backgrounds and disciplines join together to learn something new, work together, and build something awesome!

### What can I build?

You can build anything you want!

But we know how daunting that can be, so we'll make things a little easier by setting themes to help get your brain ticking. Stay tuned for those announcements!

### Do I need a team?

We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they work together.

If you don't yet have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity to form a team at the event.

### When and where is it?

The next Hack Pompey will take place during Autumn 2019 with the exact dates and locations yet to be announced.

### Some other things 

- Not a competition. Everyone is welcome, we care about this being a safe and fun environment.
- Not just coders. You don't need to have any level of skills, all areas welcome. Whether that be graphic design, coding, hardware, crafts, photography or literally anything.
- Bring your tools and equipment. Laptops, craft supplies, pen & paper, Raspberry Pis. Whatever you need for your hacking/making!
- Free food and drink. Lunch, snacks and dinner y'all. Gotta keep you fueled throughout.

If you have any other questions, please drop us a line at [hackpompey@gmail.com](mailto:hackpompey@gmail.com) or [tweet us](https://twitter.com/hackpompey).
